> TodoMVC example with full e2e test code coverage

This example is a fork of the official [Redux TodoMVC example](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux/tree/master/examples/todomvc) with a set of [Cypress.io](https://www.cypress.io) end-to-end tests. The tests run instrumented application code and the code coverage is saved automatically using [cypress-istanbul](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-istanbul) plugin.
